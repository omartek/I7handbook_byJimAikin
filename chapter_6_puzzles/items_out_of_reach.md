## Items Out of Reach {#items-out-of-reach}

Putting an important object on a high shelf or at the bottom of a narrow hole, where the object can be seen but not touched, is a common puzzle. The player may need to stand on a chair to reach the shelf, or find a giant magnet on a rope to retrieve the iron key from the hold. Sometimes the solution is to go around to an entirely different location, from where the shelf or hole bottom is reachable. Sometimes the solution is to shake the shelf so that whatâ€™s on it will fall off.
