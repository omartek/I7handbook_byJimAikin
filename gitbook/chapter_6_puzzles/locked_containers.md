## Locked Containers {#locked-containers}

As with a locked door, the usual way to open a locked container is to find the key. Sometimes the locked container has a glass door, so that whatâ€™s in it can be seen but not reached. (The way to do this in Inform is to make the container _transparent_. This word has a special meaning to the compiler and the parser.) Once in a while the solution is simply to break the container.
