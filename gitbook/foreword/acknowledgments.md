## Acknowledgments

Thanks go first and foremost to Graham Nelson for the monumental task of creating, developing, and maintaining Inform. Emily Short is tireless in her assistance and support for Inform authors. David Kinder maintains the Windows IDE (Integrated Development Environment) software for Inform 7, and Andrew Hunter the MacOS IDE. Andrew Plotkin’s Glulx system allows large games and games with extra features to be written in Inform; without Glulx, Inform would be a much less attractive proposition for game designers.

Like Inform itself, _The Inform 7 Handbook_ is a community effort. Early drafts were read by Michael Callaghan, Eric Eve, Ron Newcomb, Emily Short, Mike Tarbert, and Michael Neal Tenuis, all of whom suggested valuable additions and clarifications. I also took advantage of materials developed for other classes by Mark Engelberg and Jeff Nyman. During the writing process, the experts on the intfiction.org forum freely shared their knowledge with me; you’ll find their names scattered throughout. I also cribbed a few questions posted at intfiction.org by novice programmers, and made free use of questions and concerns raised by the students in my own IF classes.

The Inform 7 Handbook was written using OpenOffice Writer, which also handled the very nice cross-referencing and clickable table of contents in the exported PDF.

The images used in this file (other than those taken from the Inform IDE) were harvested in a frenzy of lawbreaking from various websites; it would be difficult at this late date to figure out who to credit for any of them. A number of them were downloaded from a very nice free image site called stock xchng ([www.sxc.hu](http://www.sxc.hu/)), but by now I’m not sure which ones. Copyright owners who object to this not-for-profit use of their work should contact me; I’ll be happy to remove them from future editions of the Handbook.

Thanks to all!
