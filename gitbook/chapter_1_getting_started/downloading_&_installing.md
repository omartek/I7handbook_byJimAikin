## Downloading &amp; Installing {#downloading-installing}

To get the most current version of Inform, go to the Inform website and navigate to the Downloads page http://inform7.com/downloads/. Click on the link above the icon that shows your computer operating system (Macintosh, Windows, or some variety of Linux) and download the program. You can read instructions on how to install it on each of the operating systems on the same page.

Install the program and launch it, as described in the next section.

As you work with Inform, you’ll be creating projects. Each game that you create is a separate project. It’s a good idea to start by creating a folder called Inform Projects inside your Documents (Windows: My Documents) folder. This may be done for you automatically when you install Inform, or you may need to do it manually. Each time you create a new project, save it to that folder.
