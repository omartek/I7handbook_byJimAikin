# Chapter 10: Advanced Topics {#chapter-10-advanced-topics}

To round out _The Inform 7 Handbook,_ we’ll take a quick look at some of the advanced topics that Inform authors sometimes need or want to know about. We’re not going to provide every detail about any of these topics — that would take a whole other book. But if you’re wondering what may lie ahead in your adventures with Inform, this chapter will help you get started on the right foot. For more details about how to use the features described here, you’ll need to read the Documentation and perhaps post messages to the intfiction.org forum requesting help.
